────────────────────────────────────────
Pre-Development Action Plan
Branding  ·  Wireframes  ·  Content  ·  Admin Panel  ·  Launch Checklist
February 2026
1. Executive Summary
This document bridges the gap between your three strategy documents (SEO keyword research, competitor blueprint, and technical blueprint) and actual development. It covers everything that must be decided or created before writing code: brand identity, page wireframes, content drafts for launch-critical pages, Filament admin panel architecture, and a day-by-day timeline to get from here to a live site.

Goal: Complete all items in this plan within 2 weeks, then begin development in Week 3 with zero ambiguity about design, content, or technical decisions.

2. Brand Identity System
Every design decision flows from the brand. Locking these down first prevents cascading changes during development.
2.1 Brand Positioning
Unitas Movers needs to own a clear position in the market. Based on the competitor analysis, the strongest available positioning combines three differentiators no competitor occupies simultaneously:
Differentiator
Competitor Gap
Brand Expression
Eco-friendly moving
Only EcoWay (national) competes locally
Green practices, reusable materials, carbon-conscious
Bilingual (French/English)
Zero local competitors offer this
Francophone-friendly, community-connected
Transparent, modern brand
Most competitors have dated branding
Clean design, upfront pricing, tech-forward

Proposed brand tagline options: 
    1. "Moving Calgary Forward" — implies progress, community, and forward-thinking
    2. "Your Move, Our Mission" — implies purpose, reliability, Calgary landscape
    3. "Move Clean. Move Green." — eco positioning front and center
    4. "Peak Moving Experience" — quality promise
2.2 Color Palette
The palette draws from the Canadian Rockies: deep evergreens, mountain slate, and warm earth tones. This avoids the generic blue-and-orange that dominates moving company branding (Paramount, Cactus, Two Men and a Truck all use blue or orange).

Color
Hex Code
Tailwind Class
Usage
Unitas Green (Primary)
#1B4D3E
unitas-green / green-900
Logo, headers, primary buttons, nav background
Forest (Secondary)
#2D6B4F
forest / green-700
Hover states, secondary accents, H2 headings
Meadow (Accent)
#4CAF50
meadow / green-500
CTAs, success states, eco badges
Slate (Neutral Dark)
#2C3E50
slate-dark
Body text, footer background
Stone (Neutral Mid)
#6B7B8D
stone
Muted text, borders, captions
Snow (Background)
#F8FAF9
snow
Page backgrounds, card backgrounds
Cream (Warm White)
#FDF8F0
cream
Hero sections, alternating section backgrounds
Bark (Warm Accent)
#8B6914
bark
Trust badges, review stars, warm emphasis
Summit Red (Alert)
#C0392B
summit-red
Errors, urgent CTAs, sale badges

Decision needed: Confirm the palette works for your vision. If you want a different direction (e.g., more modern/minimal with blacks and whites, or bolder with mountain blues), flag it now before any design work begins.

2.3 Typography
Typography must be distinctive without sacrificing readability. Avoid the fonts every competitor uses (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Montserrat).

Role
Font
Weight(s)
Where Used
Display / Headings
DM Serif Display
400 (regular)
H1 headings, hero text, page titles
Subheadings
Plus Jakarta Sans
600, 700
H2-H3, nav items, button text, card titles
Body Text
Plus Jakarta Sans
400, 500
Paragraphs, descriptions, form labels
Accent / Monospace
JetBrains Mono
400
Pricing numbers, calculator output, code

DM Serif Display gives Unitas a premium, established feel that contrasts with the casual sans-serif approach of most Calgary movers. Plus Jakarta Sans is modern and highly readable at all sizes. Both are free Google Fonts with excellent language support including French characters.
2.4 Logo Direction
The logo should work across all contexts: website header, truck signage, business cards, Google Business Profile avatar (which renders at 120x120px), and invoice headers.

Element
Direction
Logomark
Stylized mountain peak using clean geometric lines — not a detailed illustration. Should read clearly at 32px favicon size.
Wordmark
DM Serif Display for "Unitas" + Plus Jakarta Sans for "Movers" to create hierarchy.
Color Versions
Full color (green + dark), reversed (white on green), monochrome (dark), monochrome (white).
Favicon
Mountain peak icon only, no text. Works at 16x16, 32x32, and 180x180 (Apple Touch).
Truck Livery
Large wordmark + phone number + tagline. Mountain icon at rear. Green and white scheme.

Action: Commission logo design (Fiverr, 99designs, or local designer). Provide this spec. Budget: $150–$500. Timeline: 5–7 business days.

5. Laravel Filament Admin Panel Architecture
Filament v3 is the recommended admin panel. It integrates natively with Tailwind and Alpine.js (the same stack as the frontend), supports all the SEO-enforcement features defined in the technical blueprint, and is free for single-panel use.
5.1 Filament Resources (CRUD panels)
Each database model from the technical blueprint maps to a Filament Resource:

Resource

5.2 SEO Enforcement in Filament Forms
The admin panel must make SEO compliance the default, not an afterthought. Here is how to implement the SEO scoring system from the technical blueprint:

Form Field
Filament Component
Validation / UX
Meta Title
TextInput with ->maxLength(70)->live() + character counter
Required. Green <60 chars, yellow 60–70, red >70. Shows Google SERP preview.
Meta Description
Textarea with ->maxLength(170)->live() + counter
Required. Shows how it appears in Google results.
H1
TextInput with warning if identical to meta title
Required. Soft validation: should differ from meta title.
Slug
TextInput with ->disabled() after first save + redirect auto-creation
Auto-generated from name. Locked after publish. Edit triggers redirect creation.
Body
RichEditor with ->minLength() word count enforcement
Minimum varies by model. Live word counter in toolbar.
FAQ Section
Repeater with question + answer text fields
Minimum 3 entries for service pages. Each must have both Q and A.
Internal Links
Multi-select relationship picker
Suggest related pages. Warn if page has zero outbound links.
SEO Score
Custom Filament widget in sidebar
Auto-calculated from all SEO fields. Color badge: green/yellow/red.

5.3 Custom Dashboard Widgets
Widget

Redirect Log
Recent 301 redirects with from/to paths and creation dates
Audit trail for URL changes
Keyword Tracker
Target keyword per page, assigned/unassigned status, link to Search Console
Ensures every page maps to the keyword strategy


6. Quote Form & Lead Workflow
The quote form is the primary conversion mechanism. Its design and data flow must be defined before development.

6.2 Lead Delivery
Quotes should be delivered through multiple channels simultaneously:
    • Email notification to the operations team with all form data + Google Maps distance estimate
    • Database storage in a quotes table (viewable in Filament admin)
    • SMS notification to the owner’s phone via Twilio or Vonage (optional but recommended for fast response)
    • Auto-reply email to the customer confirming receipt with expected response time

Decision needed: Do you want to integrate with a CRM (e.g., HubSpot free tier, Pipedrive) or manage leads directly in Filament? Filament is simpler to start; CRM adds pipeline tracking and automated follow-ups.

8. Decisions Needed Before Development
These are open questions that must be resolved. Each blocks some aspect of development.

#
Decision
Options
Impact If Deferred
1
Business phone number
New 403 number via VoIP (Dialpad, OpenPhone) vs personal cell
Blocks: GBP, all content (NAP consistency), schema markup, quote form
2
Business address
Home address (hidden on GBP as SAB) vs virtual office vs coworking
Blocks: GBP verification, citation building, LocalBusiness schema
3
CRM vs Filament for leads
HubSpot Free / Pipedrive / Filament-only
Blocks: Quote form backend, email workflow, follow-up automation
4
Photography
Professional shoot ($300–$800) vs stock photos vs phone photos to start
Blocks: Homepage hero, GBP photos, service page visuals, OG images
5
Pricing structure
Hourly rates by crew size / flat-rate packages / hybrid
Blocks: Pricing page content, schema priceRange, quote form logic
6
Service area boundaries
Exact list of towns/neighborhoods actively served
Blocks: GBP service areas, area page scope, route page selection
7
French service level
Fully bilingual crew vs basic French communication vs future plan
Blocks: Bilingual page content depth, French page scope
8
Eco-friendly specifics
What specific green practices are offered (reusable bins, fuel offsets, etc.)
Blocks: Eco page content, marketing claims, certification badges

Resolve decisions #1–6 before Day 3 of the timeline. Decisions #7–8 can be refined during content writing (Days 5–9) but need at least a directional answer.


9. Development Handoff Checklist
When all items below are checked, development can begin with zero ambiguity.
